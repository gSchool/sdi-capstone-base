## Problem Statement
Most USSF missions require 24/7 crew operations. Scheduling shifts is a challenge in itself before adding the complexity of  finding last minute replacements when medical and personal issues prevent crew members from working their schedule shifts. Our system aims to have the next suitable replacement ‘OnDeck’ so if a replacement is needed, leadership do not have to spend valuable time digging through schedules and rosters to find someone to cover. All functionality needed will take place in a single easy to use web app.
